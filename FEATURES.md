## 📝 Notes
- Security improvements should be prioritized before production deployment
- Consider microservices architecture for scaling (separate booking, payment, notification services)
- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring (Serilog, Application Insights)
- Add API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI) with detailed examples
- Consider implementing CQRS pattern for complex queries
- Add health checks for database, external services
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for external API calls
- Consider adding background jobs (Hangfire) for scheduled tasks (checkout reminders, cleanup)
